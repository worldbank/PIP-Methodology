## Introduction

This file contains the information you need to update the Methodology Handbook. It is still incomplete.

## Installation

To work on this book, you will need to have R and RStudio installed.
You will also need to have the following packages installed: [NEEDS UPDATING]

## Working with the book

To update the text, just open whichever of the ".Rmd" files which needs updating. 

## Updating references

To update a reference, the easiest is just to open references.bib in notepad and manually make changes. You can also work with it through Zotero but I find that to be less reliable. Once you've updated some references, you need to knit the relevant files where they appear and then render the book (see below on that).

## Rendering the book

To render the book, make sure you have opened the file "Methodology.Rproj" in the main folder. You can check you have this file open if the very top-left of the RStudio reads "Methodology - RStudio". The buttons in RStudio, "Knit" and "Build Book" do not work. Rather you will need to type the following line directly in the console: bookdown::render_book()
