## Introduction

This file contains the information you need to update the Methodology Handbook. It is still incomplete.

## Setting everything up

To work on this book, you will need to have R and RStudio installed. You will also need to have the following packages installed: downlit, rsconnect, bookdown, DiagrammeR. Next you need to connect to posit, which eventually will allow you to update the website. To connect you need to go through the following steps:

1.  Have an internal and external posit connect account. You can request this through e-services, look for [RStudio Connect Account](https://worldbankgroup.service-now.com/wbg?id=wbg_sc_catalog&sys_id=990fc3681bf47850a4d2fff7cc4bcbca)

2.  Once granted, add the server where the handbook is hosted using the following code in R:

    `# Add new server`

    `rsconnect::addServer(`

    `"http://w0lxopshyprd1b.worldbank.org:3939",`

    `name = "external-server")`

3.  Then connect your account.

    1.  To do so, first create an API-key through posit connect. To that end, log in [here](https://datanalytics.worldbank.org/connect/), and then follow the instructions [here](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/api-keys/#:~:text=To%20create%20an%20API%20Key,to%20the%20API%20Keys%20page.). Copy the API-key.

    2.  Run the code `file.edit("~/.Renviron").`

    3.  In .Renviron type `"connect_key_ext={paste your API key here}".` Add one empty line and save.

    4.  Run the following code:

        `# Connect your account`

        `rsconnect::connectApiUser(`

        `server = "external-server",`

        `account = "dmahler", # The same of your @worldbank.org email`

        `apiKey = Sys.getenv("connect_key_ext"))`

## Working with the book

To update the text, just open whichever of the ".Rmd" files which needs updating. To update references, the easiest is just to open references.bib in notepad and manually make changes.

## Publishing the book

Once you are done with all the changes you want, take the following steps to update the online version of the handbook by running this code:

`bookdown::publish_book(name = "PIP-Methodology2", account = "dmahler", server = "external-server", render = "local")`

Obviously replace `dmahler` with your posit connect username, which is the part of your World Bank e-mail before the "\@".
